    <h2 class="dev-story-intro">Hey there! My name is Sara Fecadu.</h2>
    <h2 class="dev-story-intro">I'm a self-taught web developer based in Seattle.</h2>

    <h3 class="dev-story-question">You're self-taught! How did you learn to code?</h3>
    <p class="dev-story-body">I started by listening to podcasts on long bus rides, reading books, and taking short online courses. The following year, I quit my job, travelled around the world, and ran through many web development tutorials. Two years into this process I wrote my first application from scratch. Since then, I've written a handful of web apps and blog posts.</p>

    <p class="dev-story-body note">Below, I list technologies that I have a fairly good grasp on. But, how did I get there? <br> Feel free to click on any of the squares in the Self-taught Skills section on this page to get a better idea of my experience in the area.</p>

    <h3 class="dev-story-question">Why code?</h3>
    <p class="dev-story-body">After graduating from university, I was looking for an industry that would allow me to be both creative and analytical at work. I also wanted a career that would challenge me in year one and in year thirty-one.</p>

    <p class="dev-story-body">I didn't know that writing code would meet those requirements. To find out, I researched by listening to podcasts and reading articles. Eventually, I knew for sure that I would enjoy the challenges that come with writing software.</p>

    <h3 class="dev-story-question">What next?</h3>
    <p class="dev-story-body">At the end of last year, I decided to dive into JavaScript data visualizations head-first. I'd like to continue working on that skillset. I'd also like to round out my web development skills by writing more backend code. And I'd love to write a compiler in 2018.</p>

    <p class="dev-story-body">We'll see what I get done!</p>
